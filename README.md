# 8 dimensional haystack

The Python and Mathematica notebooks attached in this repository calculate the fraction of the multi dimensional haystack radio searches for extra terrestrial signals have combed through.

The Mathamatica notebook contains the integrals which were analytically calculated. We also provide a Python script that computes numerical values for the total haystack volume and search fraction, which we used to calculate the numbers given in the paper [INSERT HERE].
